# snake_game
This is a simple Snake Game built using Python's turtle module. The game involves controlling a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The score increases each time the snake eats food, and the game resets when the snake crashes.

**Features**
Snake Movement: Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
Food Spawning: Food appears randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as the snake grows longer.
Collision Handling: The game resets when the snake hits the walls or itself.
Smooth Animation: The game updates seamlessly with a small delay between frames.

**How to Play**
Run the script in a Python environment that supports the turtle module.
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
_Left Arrow_: Move left
_Right Arrow_: Move right

Guide the snake to the food. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and your score increases.
Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
